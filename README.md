# SwiftInputView
InputView that accepts multiple types of inputs (text/password/dialogs). Since subviews are dynamically added, it can be extended to support custom input types as well by extending **InputViewBuilderComponent** and **InputViewConfigComponent**.

To install, add:

> pod 'SwiftInputView'

into the main project's **Podfile**.

Check out **TestApplication-iOS** at [https://github.com/protoman92/TestApplication-iOS.git] for a demo.
